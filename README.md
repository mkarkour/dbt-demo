## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation

1. **Install dbt-core with DuckDB adapter**:

   ```bash
   pip install dbt-core dbt-duckdb
   ```

2. **Verify installation**:

   ```bash
   dbt --version
   ```

   The output should display the installed version of dbt-core and the dbt-duckdb adapter.

### Project Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MehdiKarkour/dbt-duckdb-demo.git
   cd dbt-duckdb-demo
   ```

2. **Configure your profiles.yml**:

   The project already contains a profiles.yml file configured for DuckDB:

   ```yaml
   demo:
     outputs:
       dev:
         type: duckdb
         path: dev.duckdb
         threads: 1
       prod:
         type: duckdb
         path: prod.duckdb
         threads: 4
     target: dev
   ```

   This configuration creates a DuckDB database file named `dev.duckdb` for your development environment.

3. **Test your connection**:

   ```bash
   dbt debug
   ```

   This command verifies that dbt can connect to DuckDB correctly.

### Processing Data with DuckDB

1. **Load sample data**:

   The project includes a Python script to load sample data:

   ```bash
   python scripts/fetch_data.py
   ```

   This script will create a DuckDB database and load the sample data from the CSV file.

2. **Explore the data**:

   You can connect to the DuckDB database using the DuckDB CLI or another SQL client:

   ```bash
   duckdb dev.duckdb
   ```

   Then run SQL queries:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sales LIMIT 10;
   ```

### Running Models

1. **Execute a specific model**:

   ```bash
   dbt run --select model_name
   ```

   For example, to run the intermediate sales model:

   ```bash
   dbt run --select int_sales
   ```

2. **Execute all models**:

   ```bash
   dbt run
   ```

3. **Test models**:

   ```bash
   dbt test
   ```

4. **Build models (run + test)**:

   ```bash
   dbt build
   ```

5. **View model results** (requires dbt v1.7+):

   ```bash
   dbt show --select model_name
   ```

### Documentation

1. **Generate documentation**:

   ```bash
   dbt docs generate
   ```

2. **Serve documentation locally**:

   ```bash
   dbt docs serve
   ```

   This will open a web browser showing the documentation for your dbt project, including:
   - Model lineage graphs
   - Table and column descriptions
   - Source data definitions
   - Test coverage

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Context

This demonstration project is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to dbt (data build tool) with DuckDB as the processing engine. DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system, making it ideal for local development and testing of dbt workflows.

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Education**: To help data professionals understand the basic concepts and workflows of dbt without needing to set up complex data warehouse infrastructure.

2. **Demonstration**: To showcase how to structure a dbt project following industry best practices, including proper organization of models, tests, documentation, and source definitions.

3. **Quick Start**: To provide a ready-to-use environment where users can experiment with dbt features and capabilities immediately.

4. **Best Practices**: To demonstrate recommended patterns for data modeling, testing, and documentation within the dbt ecosystem.

This project includes example models that transform source data through staging, intermediate, and consumption layers, demonstrating a typical analytics engineering workflow. Users can extend these examples to understand how dbt can address specific data transformation needs.

## âœ… Best Practices

This project demonstrates several dbt best practices:

### Project Structure

- **Layered approach**: Models are organized in a multi-layered architecture:
  - `staging`: Contains models that clean and standardize source data
  - `intermediate`: Contains business logic transformations
  - `consumption`: Contains final models for business consumption

### Source Configuration

- **External sources**: Properly defined source tables using the sources.yml file
- **Documentation**: Source tables include descriptions for better understanding

### Model Organization

- **Materialization strategy**: Appropriate materialization strategies are set at the project level and can be overridden at the model level
- **Naming conventions**: Consistent naming conventions across the project (e.g., `int_` prefix for intermediate models)

### Testing

- **Data tests**: Implementation of uniqueness and not-null tests for key columns
- **Schema tests**: Validation of model schema integrity

### Version Control

- **Git integration**: Project structure designed for version control
- **.gitignore**: Properly configured to exclude build artifacts and local environment files

### Documentation

- **Model documentation**: Descriptive comments and documentation for models
- **Column descriptions**: Detailed column descriptions for improved understanding
